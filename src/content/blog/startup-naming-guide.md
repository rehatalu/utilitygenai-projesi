## What's in a Name?

A lot, actually. Your business name is the first thing customers see. It's on your domain, your email, your business card. It needs to be memorable, easy to spell, and available.

Finding a name that meets all three criteria in 2025 is incredibly hard. Most "good" words are taken.

## Types of Brand Names

Before brainstorming, understand the categories:
1.  **Descriptive:** Tells you exactly what they do (e.g., General Motors, The Weather Channel). *Pro: Clarity. Con: Boring.*
2.  **Suggestive:** Hints at a benefit (e.g., Netflix, Evernote, Pinterest). *Pro: Creative. Con: Hard to find.*
3.  **Abstract:** Unique words with no prior meaning (e.g., Kodak, Rolex, Zynga). *Pro: You own the trademark. Con: Requires marketing budget to explain.*

## The Brainstorming Block

Most entrepreneurs get stuck here. They fall in love with a name, only to find the .com is taken by a squatter asking for $10,000.

### The AI Fix
The [Business Name Generator](/tool/business-name) is your brainstorming partner. It doesn't fall in love with ideas; it generates volume.
*   **Strategy:** Generate 50 names.
*   **Filter:** Remove the ones you hate.
*   **Check:** Look for domain availability for the top 5.

### Tips for 2025
*   **Short is sweet:** Aim for 2 syllables if possible (Google, Uber, TikTok).
*   **Voice compatibility:** Make sure it's easy to say for voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. If Siri spells it wrong, your customers will too.
*   **Avoid trends:** Don't misspell words just to be cool (e.g., "Flickr" eventually had to buy "Flicker.com" because everyone typed it wrong).

## The ".com" Dilemma

Do you strictly need a .com?
*   **Yes:** If you are a big consumer brand. Trust is key.
*   **No:** If you are a niche SaaS or local app. .io, .ai, and .co are perfectly acceptable now.

## Conclusion

Don't let the naming process stall your launch. Use AI to find a "good enough" name, check the domain, and start building. The brand value comes from your product, not just the name.
