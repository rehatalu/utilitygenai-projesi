## What's in a Name?

A lot, actually. Your business name is the first thing customers see. It needs to be memorable, easy to spell, and available (domain name).

### Types of Brand Names

1.  **Descriptive:** Tells you exactly what they do (e.g., General Motors).
2.  **Suggestive:** Hints at a benefit (e.g., Netflix, Evernote).
3.  **Abstract:** Unique words with no prior meaning (e.g., Kodak, Rolex).

### The Brainstorming Block

Most entrepreneurs get stuck here. They fall in love with a name, only to find the .com is taken.
* **The AI Fix:** The [Business Name Generator](/tool/business-name) is your brainstorming partner. It doesn't fall in love with ideas; it generates volume.
* **Strategy:** Generate 50 names. Filter down to 5. Check domain availability.

### Tips for 2025
* **Short is sweet:** Aim for 2 syllables if possible.
* **Voice compatibility:** Make sure it's easy to say for voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.
* **Avoid trends:** Don't misspell words just to be cool (e.g., "Flickr" eventually had to buy "Flicker.com").
