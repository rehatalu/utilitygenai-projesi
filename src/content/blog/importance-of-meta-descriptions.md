## The Unsung Hero of SEO: Meta Descriptions

A meta description is the short snippet of text that appears below your page title in search engine results (SERPs). While Google has stated that meta descriptions are not a direct ranking signal, they are vital for your SEO strategy.

### 1. It's Your Ad Copy

Think of the meta description as a free ad for your page. A compelling description convinces users to click on your link instead of your competitor's.

### 2. Impact on CTR (Click-Through Rate)

Higher CTR is a strong signal to Google that your content is relevant. If more people click on your result, your rankings can improve over time.

### 3. How to Write a Good Meta Description

* **Keep it under 160 characters:** Google typically truncates longer text.
* **Include your target keyword:** It will be bolded in search results.
* **Use a Call to Action:** Encourage users to "Learn more," "Read now," or "Discover."
