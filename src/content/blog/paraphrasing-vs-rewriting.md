## Paraphrasing vs. Rewriting

In the world of content creation, these terms are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and use cases.

* Avoid plagiarism when citing sources.
* Clarify a specific point.

### What is Rewriting?

Rewriting is a broader term that can involve substantial changes to the structure, tone, and flow of a text. It might involve:
* Updating old content.
* Changing the target audience.
* Optimizing for SEO keywords.

### When to Use Which?

* Use **Paraphrasing** for academic writing, quoting sources, or clarifying short passages.
* Use **Rewriting** for refreshing blog posts, repurposing content for social media, or improving overall readability.

Both techniques are essential for maintaining high-quality, unique content.
